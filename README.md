`hoodie-server` is the core server component of Hoodie. Together with `hoodie-client`, it forms the two parts that make up the Hoodie system.

`hoodie-server` is responsible for a number of things on the server:

- check the environment to make sure Hoodie can run properly
- start an instance of CouchDB, Hoodie‚Äôs database
- start a webserver each for the Hoodie app itself and the Hoodie Admin Dashboard
- start all Hoodie plugins that might be installed

`hoodie-server` isn‚Äôt meant to be used by itself and it is used by the `hoodie` module, which also inlcude `hoodie-client` to form Hoodie.

You can use `hoodie-server` on its own, if you want to work on it, help fix bugs or test new versions. And when you are writing your own plugin, you can use `hoodie-server` for debugging.

## Usage

As noted before, this isn‚Äôt meant to be run standalone, but if you are helping out with development, or build your own plugins, or just want to spelunk around, here‚Äôs how it works:

```
git clone git@github.com:hoodiehq/hoodie-server.git
cd hoodie-server
npm install
```

When that‚Äôs done, you can run `./bin/start` to start `hoodie-server`. Usually, `hoodie-server` is run within the context of an existing frontend application, but when you run it alone, it will use its `www/` directory to serve the web app. For now, this is just a simple `index.html` file that says `hi`.

There are a few options to change the behaviour of `hoodie-server`. See a list by running `./bin/start --help`. It looks something like this:

```
Usage: npm start -- [options]

Options:
  --www           Set www root directory
  --custom-ports  Provide custom ports www,admin,couchdb
  --in-memory     Use a pure in-memory database which will be deleted upon restart
  --help          Show usage information
  --loglevel      Set the loglevel [default: "warn"]
  --silly         Set the loglevel to silly
  --verbose       Set the loglevel to verbose
  --info          Set the loglevel to info
  --http          Set the loglevel to http
  --warn          Set the loglevel to warn
  --error         Set the loglevel to error
  --silent        Set the loglevel to silent
```

If that doesn‚Äôt make much sense just yet, don‚Äôt worry about it.

## Testing

The `hoodie-server` test suite is run with `npm test`.

The tests live in `test/unit` and `test/integration`. `test/unit` tests (or ‚Äúunit tests‚Äù) are to test the behaviour of individual sub-modules within `hoodie-server`, while `test/integration` tests (or ‚Äúintegration tests‚Äù) are used to test the behaviour of a fully running instance of `hoodie-server`, e.g. the behaviour of its HTTP API.

If you are adding new features to `hoodie-server` you should provide test cases for the new feature. Depending on the feature, you either best write unit tests or integration tests and sometimes even both. The more tests we have, the more confidently we can release future versions of `hoodie-server`.
