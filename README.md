Hoodie lets you build apps [without _thinking_ about the backend](http://nobackend.org/)
and makes sure that they work great [independent from connectivity](http://offlinefirst.org/).

This is Hoodie’s main repository. It starts a server and serves the client API.
Read more about [Hoodie’s core modules](#architecture).

A good place to start is our [Tracker App](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-app-tracker).
You can play around with Hoodie’s APIs in the browser console and see how it
works all together in its [simple HTML & JavaScript code](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-app-tracker/tree/master/public).

If you have any questions come say hi in our [chat](http://hood.ie/chat/).

## Setup

`npm install --save hoodie`

Add this to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "hoodie"
}
```

Now run `npm start` to start your Hoodie app.

## Usage

Run `npm start -- --help` to see all available CLI options.

Options can also be specified as environment variables (prefixed with `hoodie_`) or inside a `.hoodierc` file (json or ini).

public        | path.join(options.path, 'public')  | path to static assets
inMemory      | false                              | Whether to start the PouchDB Server in memory
dbUrl         | –                                  | If provided uses external CouchDB. Has to contain credentials.
data          | path.join(options.path, '.hoodie') | Data path

Hoodie is using the [rc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc) module to retrieve
configuration from CLI arguments, environment variables and configuration files.

## Testing

```
git clone https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie.git

## Architecture

Hoodie is server built on top of [hapi](http://hapijs.com) with frontend APIs
for account and store related tasks.

It consists of three main components

1. [**account**](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-account)  
   Hoodie’s account module. It exposes [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) routes,
   a corresponding server API at `server.plugins.account.api`,
   a client API and a generic account UI.

1. [**store**](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-store)  
   Hoodie’s store module. It exposes [CouchDB’s Document API](https://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_Document_API),
   a corresponding client and a generic store UI.

1. [**client**](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-client)  
   Hoodie’s front-end client for the browser. It integrates the following client modules:
   1. [account-client](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-account-client)
   2. [store-client](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-store-client)
   3. [log-client](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-log-client)
   4. [connection-status](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-connection-status)
