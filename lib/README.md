[back to hoodie](../README.md)

# hoodie/server

After [installing hoodie](../#setup), `npm start` will run [bin/start.js](../bin/start.js)
which reads out [configuration](../#usage) from all the different places using
the [rc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc) package, then passes it as options to
`getHoodieServer`, the main function returned by this package, defined in
[server/index.js](index.js).

Hoodie is built on [Hapi](http://hapijs.com).

In `getHoodieServer` the passed options are amended with defaults and parsed
into configuration for the Hapi server and the core modules (see [architecture](#architecture)).
For example, [hoodie-account-server](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-account-server)
and [hoodie-store-server](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-store-server) require
different options, which are extracted from options and stored in `config.account`
and `config.store` respectively.

Hoodie uses [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) for data persistence and
authentication. If `options.dbUrl` is not set, it falls back to [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/).

Once all configuration is taken care of, the internal plugins are initialised
(see [server/plugins/index.js](plugins/index.js)). We define simple Hapi plugins
for [logging](plugins/log.js) and for [serving the app’s public assets and the Hoodie client](plugins/public.js).
We also load the core modules and register them with the Hapi server.

Once everything is setup, `getHoodieServer` runs the callback and passes the
Hapi `server` instance. The server is then started at the end of [bin/start.js](../bin/start.js)
and the URL where hoodie is running is logged to the terminal.

## Architecture

Hoodie is a server built on top of [hapi](http://hapijs.com) with frontend APIs
for account and store related tasks.
